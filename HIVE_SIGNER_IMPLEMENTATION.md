# HiveSigner Implementation Summary

## Overview
We have successfully implemented HiveSigner authentication as an alternative to HiveKeychain in the Hive Token Swap application. This provides users with more flexibility in how they authenticate and interact with the Hive blockchain.

## Setup Requirements

### App Registration
To use HiveSigner in production, you need to register your application at https://hivesigner.com. For development, the default configuration will work with localhost.

### Configuration
The application uses the following default configuration for HiveSigner:
- **App Name**: hive-token-swap
- **Callback URL**: http://localhost:3000
- **Scope**: login, vote, comment, custom_json, transfer

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Type Definitions
- **src/types/hivesigner.ts**: Created type definitions for HiveSigner client, responses, and user data

### 2. Configuration
- **src/constants/hivesigner.ts**: Created configuration constants for HiveSigner

### 3. Context Provider
- **src/providers/HiveSignerProvider.tsx**: Created a React context provider for managing HiveSigner authentication state

### 4. Custom Hooks
- **src/hooks/useHiveSigner.ts**: Created hooks for authentication and blockchain operations

### 5. UI Components
- **src/components/wallet/WalletConnection.tsx**: Updated to support both HiveKeychain and HiveSigner authentication methods

### 6. Documentation
- **src/app/wallet-setup/page.tsx**: Updated wallet setup guide to include HiveSigner
- **src/app/page.tsx**: Updated main page to mention both wallet options

## Features Implemented

### Authentication
- Login with HiveSigner OAuth flow
- User session management
- Logout functionality
- User data retrieval

### Blockchain Operations
- Vote operations
- Comment operations
- Custom JSON operations
- Reblog operations
- Follow/Unfollow operations

## Integration Points

### Wallet Connection Component
The WalletConnection component now supports both authentication methods:
1. HiveKeychain (browser extension)
2. HiveSigner (OAuth-based authentication)

Users can choose their preferred method based on their setup.

### Context Provider
The HiveSignerProvider manages the authentication state and provides it to components through the useHiveSigner hook.

### Custom Hooks
Two hooks were created:
1. useHiveSignerAuth - For authentication-related functionality
2. useHiveSignerOperations - For blockchain operations

## Usage

To use HiveSigner in components:

```tsx
import { useHiveSignerAuth, useHiveSignerOperations } from '@/hooks/useHiveSigner';

// In your component
const { user, isAuthenticated, login, logout } = useHiveSignerAuth();
const { vote, comment, customJson } = useHiveSignerOperations();

// Login
const handleLogin = () => {
  login();
};

// Vote
const handleVote = async () => {
  try {
    await vote('voter', 'author', 'permlink', 10000);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Vote failed', error);
  }
};
```

## HiveSigner vs HiveKeychain

### HiveKeychain
- Browser extension that stores private keys locally
- Direct access to private keys
- No need for OAuth flow
- Requires installation of browser extension

### HiveSigner
- OAuth-based authentication service
- No private keys stored in the application
- Web-based authentication flow
- Works on mobile devices and browsers without extensions
- No installation required

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid Credentials" Error
If you're seeing "invalid credentials" when trying to log in with HiveSigner:

1. Make sure you're entering your Hive username and password (not private key) on the HiveSigner website
2. Ensure your account is properly registered on HiveSigner
3. Check that you're using the correct app credentials in the configuration

### HiveSigner Not Loading
If HiveSigner is not loading:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify that the hivesigner.min.js script is being loaded
3. Check browser console for any errors

## Future Improvements

1. Add more comprehensive tests
2. Implement additional HiveSigner operations
3. Add error handling and user feedback
4. Implement token refresh functionality
5. Add support for HiveSigner mobile authentication
