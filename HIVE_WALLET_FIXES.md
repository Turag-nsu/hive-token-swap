# Hive Wallet Integration Fixes

## Overview
Based on the Hive Keychain documentation, we've fixed and improved the wallet integration in the Hive Token Swap application. The implementation now properly supports both Hive Keychain (browser extension) and HiveSigner (OAuth-based authentication).

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Fixed WalletConnection Component
- Properly implemented `requestHandshake` and `requestSignBuffer` methods for Hive Keychain
- Added user authentication flow that prompts for username after successful keychain verification
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Added support for both authentication methods in the UI

### 2. Created AccountManager Component
- Implemented a component to display account information
- Added proper formatting for HIVE and HBD balances
- Included Hive Power calculation from VESTS
- Added quick actions for viewing account activity

### 3. Added Custom Hooks
- `useWalletData`: Fetches and manages wallet data
- `useWalletOperations`: Provides wallet operations (transfer, sign buffer, broadcast)

### 4. Improved HiveSigner Integration
- Properly initialized HiveSigner client with app configuration
- Implemented authentication flow using the official hivesigner package
- Added proper error handling

## Authentication Flow

### Hive Keychain
1. Check if extension is installed using `requestHandshake`
2. Request user to sign a message using `requestSignBuffer`
3. Prompt user for their Hive username
4. Display account information

### HiveSigner
1. Initialize client with app configuration
2. Redirect user to HiveSigner OAuth flow
3. Receive authentication token
4. Fetch user information using `me` method

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Always check for Keychain availability** before making requests
2. **Handle errors gracefully** in all callbacks
3. **Provide clear user feedback** during authentication process
4. **Support both authentication methods** for better user experience
5. **Properly manage state** during authentication flow

## Future Improvements

1. Implement proper backend verification for signed messages
2. Add real-time balance updates from the Hive blockchain
3. Implement full transaction history
4. Add support for Hive Engine tokens
5. Implement more advanced wallet operations (delegations, witness voting, etc.)
