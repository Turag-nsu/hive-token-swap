## 1. Introduction

The rise of social media platforms has fundamentally transformed how people communicate, share information, and build communities. However, traditional centralized platforms often suffer from issues such as censorship, data privacy concerns, and lack of user ownership over content. This thesis explores the development of a decentralized alternative built on the Hive blockchain, which addresses these concerns while maintaining the familiar features users expect from social media platforms.

The Hive Token Swap Platform represents a novel approach to social networking by combining the benefits of blockchain technology with user-friendly interfaces. Users can create, share, and engage with content while earning cryptocurrency rewards for their contributions. The platform's integrated wallet system allows users to manage their digital assets seamlessly within the social environment.
