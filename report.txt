Developer: Md. Abdullah Al Noman Turag, Abdulla Al Nayem, Prithi Zaglul, Nusrat Jahan Tisha

Project Overview:
The Hive Social Platform is a decentralized social media application built on the Hive blockchain ecosystem. Unlike traditional centralized platforms, this system gives users true ownership of their content while providing integrated financial features. The platform combines familiar social networking capabilities with cryptocurrency wallet management and token swapping functionality.

Key Features:
- Decentralized social media (posting, commenting, following)
- Integrated cryptocurrency wallet for HIVE, HBD, and Hive Engine tokens
- Real-time transaction history tracking
- Token swap functionality within the Hive ecosystem
- User profiles with gift sending capabilities
- Dark/light theme support with modern UI/UX design

Technical Implementation:
- Framework: Next.js 15 with React 19
- Language: TypeScript
- Blockchain Integration: @hiveio/dhive library for direct blockchain communication
- Wallet Authentication: HiveKeychain and HiveSigner
- UI/UX Enhancements: GSAP animations, Framer Motion
- State Management: React Query and Zustand
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with glassmorphism effects

Recent Accomplishments:
1. Replaced all mock data with real Hive blockchain API integration:
   - Real account data fetching
   - Live transaction history
   - Accurate balance calculations (HIVE, HBD, Hive Power)
   - Support for multiple operation types (transfers, power operations, delegations)

2. Enhanced social features:
   - User profile pages with statistics
   - Gift sending functionality between users
   - Theme-consistent UI components (buttons, cards, modals)
   - Responsive design for all device sizes

3. Improved technical documentation with 20 graphical diagram components:
   - System architecture flowcharts
   - Component hierarchy diagrams
   - Data flow visualizations
   - Wallet integration process diagrams
   - Social media feature architecture diagrams
   - Blockchain interaction sequence diagrams

Technology Stack Highlights:
- Next.js 15 (with Turbopack)
- React 19 with TypeScript
- Hive blockchain integration
- Advanced animation libraries (GSAP, Framer Motion)
- Modern state management (React Query, Zustand)
- Responsive design (Tailwind CSS)

The platform represents a complete decentralized social media solution that bridges the gap between blockchain technology and mainstream social networking, providing users with both social connectivity and financial sovereignty.
