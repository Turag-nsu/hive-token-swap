# HiveSigner Integration Fix

## Issue
The HiveSigner integration was not properly handling the OAuth callback flow. When users logged in with HiveSigner, they were redirected back to the app with an access token in the URL, but the app wasn't processing this token to authenticate the user.

## Root Cause
1. The APP_NAME in the HiveSigner configuration was set to 'hive-token-swap', which is not a valid Hive account
2. The HiveSigner provider wasn't checking for access tokens in the URL callback
3. The login flow was using the `login` method instead of redirecting to the login URL

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Configuration
- Changed APP_NAME to an empty string for development
- Only include app name in client configuration if it's not empty

### 2. Implemented Callback Handling
- Added code to check for access tokens in URL parameters on page load
- Set access token in the HiveSigner client when present
- Fetch user information after setting the access token
- Remove access token from URL after processing to avoid infinite loops

### 3. Fixed Login Flow
- Changed login method to redirect to HiveSigner login URL instead of using the callback method
- Properly handle the connecting state during login

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- Added better error messages and logging
- Clear access token from URL on logout

## Testing
Created test pages to verify the integration:
- `/test/hivesigner-callback` - Tests the callback flow
- Updated `/test` page with links to all debug pages

## How It Works Now

1. User clicks "Login with HiveSigner"
2. App redirects to HiveSigner OAuth page
3. User authenticates and grants permissions
4. HiveSigner redirects back to app with access_token in URL
5. App detects access_token, sets it in the client, and fetches user info
6. User is now authenticated in the app
